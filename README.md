# womenintech_python_bitirme_projesi

The objective of this project was to conduct an extensive data exploratory data analysis on Olympics History Data. I used Python Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to achieve this goal. The endpoint of my analysis was to extract dominant features that distinguished female and male winners in the Olympics between 1896 and 2016.
