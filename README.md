In this project, I had some data which belongs to "Olympics History"between the years 1896 and 2016. This dataset contains a lot information about the participants phisical appearance such as their age, height, weight, and also a lot of information about the game such as place, time, medal type, etc. I asked multiple questions and tried to find the answers of my questions based on my data.
